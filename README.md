# 🌐 CycleTracker - PWA Project

## 📘 Introduction

This repository is my first hands-on project exploring **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**. I've started learning PWA to understand how modern web technologies can help build applications that are fast, reliable, installable, and capable of working offline—just like native apps.

> “Using the languages of the web, we can create fully functional applications that work online, offline, and across devices—without the overhead of app stores or platform-specific SDKs.”

Before starting this project, I referred to and documented some foundational concepts, which helped me understand how PWAs work:

### ✅ PWA Core Concepts:

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) but enhanced with features like offline support, installability, and push notifications.
- **Cross-platform**: Write once, run anywhere—from browsers to OS desktop and mobile.
- **Offline Capability**: Caching strategies allow the app to run even when the internet is not available.
- **Background Functionality**: Using **Service Workers**, PWAs can fetch data, sync, and update content in the background.
- **Installable**: Users can install PWAs from the browser itself, making them feel like native apps.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **Service Worker API**
- **Fetch API**
- **Cache API**
- **Web App Manifest**

## 🔄 Caching Strategies in PWA

| Strategy | Description | Best Use |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **Cache First** | Load from cache if available, else go to network | Static assets like JS, CSS, images |
| **Stale-While-Revalidate** | Serve from cache, but update in background | Content pages |
| **Network First** | Try network first, fallback to cache | Dynamic data/APIs |
| **Cache Only** | Load only from cache | Rarely-changing files |
| **Network Only** | Always fetch from network | Secure/authenticated data |
